<h2> micro to Macro: build your own era </h2>

<h3> Introduction </h3>

The growth and development of UMKM (Usaha Mikro, Kecil, dan Menengah) in Indonesia has held a paramount focus due to their substantial presence and pivotal role in driving the nation’s economic growth. UMKM has contributed to presenting most of the employment, boosting local economic growth, and improving the economy. However, UMKM faces various obstacles that hinder their full potential which affects their ability to grow.  

The UMKM sector encounters obstacles which include legalization, limited financial resources, lack of digital infrastructure, insufficient opportunities for skills development, market expansion, and many more. Numerous UMKMs have encountered various difficulties to navigate the complexities of modern business practice and how to connect with a broader customer base. Moreover, some UMKMs lack adequate knowledge and support in adopting sustainable and socially responsible business practices, hindering their ability to thrive in the market. 

In addition to these challenges, UMKMs frequently struggle to access appropriate networking and collaboration opportunities. Their capacity to establish strategic alliances and broaden their reach is hampered by the lack of platforms to connect with other potential business partners. Furthermore, while digital transformation is essential in today’s business environment, many UMKMs encounter barriers in implementing technology and e-commerce solutions due to a lack of technical resources. Addressing these issues to UMKMs could empower them to overcome obstacles and contribute even more significantly to Indonesia’s economic growth.
